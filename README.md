# How to run

 Make sure you have MinGW installed and access to a `make` executable (I guess this would work for anything with a make, but I did it on Windows. WIll test Ubuntu later).

 run make and the makefile will do it's thing.

 You can then run the `funee.exe` after and you should get `3` as output in the console.

# Cabal branch

If you are on the `cabal` branch, just run `cabal build` and viola! It runs!

See examples of using cabal to build [here](http://blog.ezyang.com/2010/06/setting-up-cabal-the-ffi-and-c2hs/)
